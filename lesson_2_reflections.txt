What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

we creat an empty file called .git an it is hidden,we need to do this to track our changes an o store our commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it makes the thing easer 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by logcly commiting hhahaha
